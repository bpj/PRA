## Diacritics in PRA

In PRA diacritics (which from a technical/Unicode
standpoint may be either combining marks or modifier
letters) serve to add, remove or change phonetic and/or
phonemic !index(properties)(property)
of signs, whether these signs are base letters or are
already modified by other diacritics. The term !em(property) has been choosen in preference to !em(feature) because PRA (at least as yet) does not operate with any formally 

In principle,
and always from the point of view of "core" PRA each
diacritic always modifies one and the same property in
one and the same way.
