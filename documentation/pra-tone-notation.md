One area where PRA is wholly or almost wholly innovative
is one aspect of its tone notation: the use of dots
above and/or below the actual tone marks to indicate the
relative height of tones. The principle is really simple:
«á» is mid rising, «ȧ́» is high rising and «á̇» is low rising,
so that the dot indicates where mid is. In some cases
further dots may be useful: if there for example is both a
low-to-high rising tone and a mid rising tone one may use
«á» for the former and «ȧ́̇» for the latter, but it may of
course be possible to for example get away with using
«ȧ́» for a rising tone which does not start fully low. If
one really needs five (or more) levels stacking dots is
possible; for example «ā̇̇ ā̇ ā/ǡ̇ ǡ ȧ̇̄» may theoretically be
used to indicate five level tones, with «ā̇̇» being "two
steps below mid" and so on.

Deterred by the failure (in my opinion) of the IPA to use a
single system of tone marks for both countour and
register tone PRA has two distinct systems of using the
same tone marks:

: Contour tone marking in PRA

| Mark | Meaning
|---|------
| ā | level
| á | rising
| à | falling
| â | rising-falling 
| ǎ | falling-rising


: Register tone marking in PRA

| Mark | Meaning
|---|------
| ā | mid
| á | high
| à | low
| â | upstep
| ǎ | downstep

Note that if there are more than three levels in a
register tone system dots may be used to "push" lower
and higher: «à̇ à ā̇ ā ǡ á ȧ́» for a theoretical seven
levels.
